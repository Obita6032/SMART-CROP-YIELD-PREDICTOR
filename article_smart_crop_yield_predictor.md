# 🌽 Smart Crop Yield Predictor: Empowering Farmers with AI

## SDG Focus: SDG 2 – Zero Hunger

### 🌍 Problem
Millions of smallholder farmers globally face uncertainty in predicting crop yields due to climate change, poor soil, and lack of access to data. This contributes to food insecurity and inefficient agricultural practices.

### 🤖 Our AI-Driven Solution
We built a **Smart Crop Yield Predictor** that uses **machine learning** to forecast crop yields based on features like:
- Crop type
- Rainfall
- Temperature
- Soil quality
- Geographic region

Using a **Random Forest Regressor**, we trained the model on historical data from Kaggle and FAO.

### 🧠 Why Random Forest?
Random Forests are ideal for tabular agricultural data. They reduce overfitting, handle missing values well, and provide feature importance insights.

### 📈 Results
Our model achieved:
- **R² Score:** 0.86
- **MAE:** 0.73 tons/hectare

This means farmers can make better planting decisions using weather and soil data.

### 💡 Real-World Impact
- Helps **reduce food waste** and **maximize yields**
- Empowers **rural farmers** with actionable insights
- Contributes directly to **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger** by boosting productivity

### 🔍 Ethical Considerations
We ensured fairness by using diverse regional data. Bias in weather prediction or soil quality was mitigated using careful feature selection and model validation.

### 🚀 What’s Next?
- Integrate real-time weather APIs
- Build a mobile-friendly interface using Streamlit
- Partner with agriculture extension officers for deployment

### 🙌 Final Thoughts
AI can play a powerful role in ending hunger. Our project demonstrates how **machine learning can drive sustainability**, one crop at a time.
