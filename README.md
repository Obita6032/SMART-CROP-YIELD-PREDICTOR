# SMART-CROP-YIELD-PREDICTOR

✅ Project Overview
Title: Smart Crop Yield Predictor
SDG Goal: SDG 2 – Zero Hunger
ML Technique: Supervised Learning – Random Forest
Dataset: FAO crop stats + Rainfall + Soil Quality (from Kaggle)
Goal: Predict crop yields using environmental and agricultural features to help farmers plan better
Impact: Improve food security by enabling efficient agricultural decision-making

🧠 Step 1: Define the Problem
We aim to predict crop yield (output in tons/hectare) based on:

Crop type

Soil type/quality

Rainfall

Temperature

Location

📥 Step 2: Get the Dataset
We'll use combined data from:

FAO Crop Production Data

Kaggle datasets:

Crop Yield Prediction Dataset

Rainfall in India

Soil Quality Data

Would you like me to:

Help combine and clean these datasets?

Generate sample code to simulate the project (in case you're working offline or on paper)?

⚙️ Step 3: Model Design
We’ll use Random Forest Regressor to predict yield from features.

Input Features (X):

Crop type (encoded)

Soil type

Rainfall (mm)

Temperature (°C)

State/Region

Output (y):

Crop yield (tons/hectare)
